# Data Visualization


> When communicating results to non-technical types there is nothing better than a clear visualization to make a point.

##-John Tukey


???
+ Start by asking the class "What is data viz?" "Why do we do it?" Then read next two quotes as support of what class said.

# Data Visualization

> There are two goals when presenting data: convey your story and establish credibility.

## -Edward Tufte

# Let's take a look at some of the more popular types

---

# Type of Chart by Data Type

???
+ In this series of photos, talk the students through the way we chart categorical vs numerical data
+ Point out why bar and pie charts are the most commonly seen (you can use them with any type of data)

# Use of Color

--

## Use color intentionally to make comprehension and interpretation easier. 
---

# Use of Color


## **For Sequential Numbers**
--

+ Use color scales with the darkest color representing the highest number and the lightest color representing the lowest number
--

+ Consider using two hues running light to dark for even more clarity

---

# Use of Color


## **For Categorical Data**
--

+ Each category gets its own color
---

# Use of Color


## **For Any Type of Data**
--

+ Consider grey to be the most important color. Use it to show the less important data while accentuating value(s) of interest in a color.

---

# Tips for Using Color
--

+ Be sure there's a sufficient difference between your colors
--

+ Color scales are worth exploring
--

+ Watch out for the connotation of certain colors (ex: red)
--

+ Avoid patterns
--

+ Don't use more than 6 colors
--

+ Resource for color scales: [Color Brewer](http://colorbrewer2.org)

>Clutter and confusion are failures of design, not attributes of information.

## -Edward Tufte

???
+ Class's thoughts on this? What does it mean? Do you agree?

---

# Data-Ink Ratio
--

+ Ink used to describe the data / ink used to describe everything else
--

+ Want the ratio to be high (two numbers as close as possible to each other)
--

+ Tufte calls the "everything else" chartjunk

---

# Common Types of Chartjunk
--

+ Dark gridlines
--

+ Overuse of bright, bold colors
--

+ Unnecessary use of all uppercase
--

+ Unnecessary legends
--

+ Background color

---

# Data-Ink Ratio

---

# Your Turn
--

+ Graphically represent the analyses you have done so far
--

+ Incorporate data viz concepts we have discussed

???
+ Give students approx 20 minutes

---

# .center[15 Minute Break]
--

+ Leave up on your monitor one chart you'd like feedback on
--

+ During break, visit 3 computers
--

+ Leave feedback for each chart on a Post-It stuck to the monitor
--

+ Remember to honor the assumption of noble regard and positive intent (i.e. don't be a jerk)


---

# Your Turn
--

+ Incorporate the feedback you received on your chart
--

+ Create a quick presentation of your data story to share with the class
--

+ We'll be here to help
--

+ Make sure you've updated your documentation
